0,Difficulty registering signing up,"Cannot register, keep nothing pop up On sign up"
1,Difficulty registering signing up,"Cannot seem to open the app suddenly. Did not install new apps or change any setting on phone. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling still no avail. Although your CSO has been trying to rectify, it is still unsolvable. Sad, as when it first came out, I was the one of the many who applied in the beginning stage. Your services helped me. But now I have no access to it."
2,Difficulty registering signing up,I seem to be having issues with the opening of the app.
3,Difficulty registering signing up,I can't seem to register!!!!
4,Slow or delayed transfers,"Hit with fast reversal when transferring money to this gxs bank, first time in my life a fast transfer didn‚Äôt succeed. Googled for recent reviews and social media on this gxs bank. Mostly bad reviews and issues. I don‚Äôt need developer reply to my review here as I‚Äôm absolutely not going to touch this bank anymore. And biggest joke of all, you don‚Äôt even have the most basic banking feature to save payee details. What kind of app development staff and quality is that???"
5,Slow or delayed transfers,Quick transfers to bank acc and fast repayments. Very suitable for short term loans
6,Issues with loan approval and process,"What is the criteria to approve the loan? Each time my hubby and I tried to apply loan multiple time, it get rejected. I wonder how much do we need to earn every month to get the loan approved!! If you have some rules and criteria then state it out so people won't waste time applying."
7,Issues with loan approval and process,I have merely tried to apply for your flexi loan on this app. But when i tried to applied like 9 times straight i have been instantly being asked to reapply over and over again. Very bad for user experience and does not live up to expectations till today
8,Issues with loan approval and process,Whats with the Loan Thingy ???
9,App freezing or not opening,"Cannot seem to open the app suddenly. Did not install new apps or change any setting on phone. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling still no avail. Although your CSO has been trying to rectify, it is still unsolvable. Sad, as when it first came out, I was the one of the many who applied in the beginning stage. Your services helped me. But now I have no access to it."
10,App freezing or not opening,I seem to be having issues with the opening of the app.
11,Lack of certain features such as bank transfer option,Almost perfect; I want to transfer via bank account number but they do no allow me to save the bank details so I'm stuck twitch manually entering the details everytime when I need to do transfer which can be prone to human error.
12,Poor customer service,"Is GXS looking into this issue? Going to be a week, still something is wrong. What happened to iOS user testing before roll out? It‚Äôs baffling the slow service recovery GXS is impressing upon iOS users."
13,Bugs or glitches in the app,"Simple, straightforward to use with no bugs. Great experience"
14,Complaints about the setup and design process,Dogshit app that takes forever to setup and days to review applications
15,Others,"Have been waiting for a slot for the account since GXS started and have been waiting until now (about 7 months) and still nothing, whenever anyone ask for why, the excuses given are still mostly the same with no actual changes or improvements (people can‚Äôt help but compare to the other bank ‚Äútrust bank Singapore‚Äù that also launched just 1 day before GXS‚Äôs launch and believe trust bank Singapore to be better since trust bank can allow people to register without waiting for this long)"
16,Others,"Great app, with awesome design and theme unlike traditional banking institutions. Provide high interest rates and suitable for targeted group of audience. Ratings were probably dragged down by reviewers who rated 1/5 because they couldn‚Äôt sign up - as GXS bank is rolling out to users by batches.

Overall a good experience! :)"
17,Others,Easy to use. Fast transfer.
18,Others,"What a joke! Nothing happens after you input your phone number - nothing! 

It‚Äôll be so much, and I don‚Äôt exaggerate when I say this, so much faster for you to travel from one end of Singapore to the other, to open an account at a traditional bank branch. 

One piece of advice to the management of GXS Bank - do not launch if you are not ready! You are a joke. Please look at Trust Bank. Simple and easy to use. Account opened in like, 2 mins?"
19,Others,"I recently used this digital bank, which has many security features and user friendly UI.
I 100% recommend to used this App."
20,Others,Easy drawing and repayment option. Flexible of choice at any time with any needs. Like it and good tool for emergency money with flexible borrowing and repayment.
21,Others,It really helps when really in need. So easy to do it. It's at your fingertips.
22,Others,The app is easy to navigate and optimise for people of all ages.
23,Others,"Stuck on Oops, something went wrong page when opening the app, while overseas. I can't imagine if I was in a urgent situation and my banking app failed like this. No way to access funds through a browser too means you can't do anything at all other than hope the problem is fixed soon. Put what you can afford to lose."
24,Others,"Beautiful graphics and theme, user-friendly"
25,Others,best app experience looking forward for more breakthrough features in digi banking.
26,Others,"The app is very user friendly and easy to set up. I personally like the way they take information security seriously by making sure our phone is secure (via pin authentication). With all thats happening around, makes me so much more reassured that they take security seriously!"
27,Others,Apps is fast and UI is cool
28,Others,This is very good. Really very helpful. I Will keep in touch with them. üëåüèΩüòç
29,Others,Loan disbursement was immediate. App is simple to use. Repayments just as easy.
30,Others,"Not prepared? Then don‚Äôt launch. See your direct competitor got a pure breeze of experience. Onboarding was swift and fast. Just think the reviews here are just made by the staff lol, focusing on UI/UX what a joke. Best UI/UX where others cannot experience YET."
31,Others,Nice And Fast Bank
32,Others,"What if I urgently need access to my money? This is not the way to go.
ü§¨"
33,Others,Seamless registration. All done in less than 15 mins. Signed up and funds loaded. I guess they improved the app compared to the issues faced by other users earlier on.
34,Others,"Sorry to have said this, why not this gxbank through by gxbank for worldwide"
