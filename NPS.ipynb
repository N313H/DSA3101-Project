Moreover the interest rate they give is the highest for the no effort! Interest are being deposit daily and it‚Äôs amazing to see üíµ coming in to the bank daily! \\r\\n\\r\\nThe user interfaces is so intuitive that every button can be found with your eyes close, that makes money transfer so much smoother. Also the colours is so slick that I want to turn the app on everyday just to look at it and see the daily interest\\r\\n\\r\\nLots of potential for the product and I can‚Äôt wait to see more of it.', 'Notice that the drop in interest rate of 0.8% in saving accounts. GXS just come out with a reason to say many consumers want a increase in interest rate in main accounts as most of their funds are there to get the 1.2x points for dash and grab spending. Hence they decrease the interest rate to 2.68% in saving account and increase to 2.38% in main account .\\r\\n\\r\\nThe thing is GXS can increase the main account interest and maintain the interest rate in saving account. They will attract more consumer in this case. However, they use this opportunity to decease the interest rate in saving account instead and use the consumer as an excuse for the decrease.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am very disappointed in GXS and have close my account in GXS. There are other banks offering a higher interest rate such as OCBC and UOB for saving accounts. No point sticking to GXS.', 'Sending money into my GXS account is a breeze and instantaneous - regardless of the amounts. I‚Äôm able to immediately see that my funds are in GXS. \\r\\n\\r\\nTransferring money OUT is a huge issue. Since June I‚Äôve had problems transferring amounts higher than $500 back to my other banking accounts, each time a red banner will pop up and said something went wrong please try again later. TODAY I can‚Äôt transfer more than $1000 back to myself - even the $1000 had to be transferred in TWO transactions of $500 each. Customer service officers did their best to help each time but it‚Äôs annoying that the advice provided (killing the app, re-logging in with SingPass) still don‚Äôt work.', 'I have to say that the UI/UX is one of the best one I‚Äôll have seen for any Digibank mobile app and finally a strong market player that focuses on customer experience and design, which is critical as most banking products doesn‚Äôt differ much for any banks out there.

You are a joke. Please look at Trust Bank. Simple and easy to use. Account opened in like, 2 mins?', 'Honestly is my first time depositing digital banking A lot worry . But at the end is a great experience. I believe a lot of us wanted is the return . And they offer very high interest. Will continue to deposit Thank you', 'My biggest frustration is that I can‚Äôt save payees when sending money.  Everytime I need to transfer funds, I have to select a transfer type and fully type out the account number, payee‚Äôs name, and select the bank.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is incredibly tedious esp for accounts I pay frequently.

With your latest move to reduce interest to 2.68% has made me feels like maribank is better even with slightly lower interest rate because they knows what basic functions to include in the app', 'Extremely disappointed with the GXS app. Despite consistent use on the same device for a long time, it suddenly stopped allowing money transfers with explanation device changed. This lack of clarity and abrupt disruption in service is unacceptable. Terrible user experience, deserves only 1 star.', 'Wish more people can download and use, and more rewards can be given.', 'Can try for saving money !!
