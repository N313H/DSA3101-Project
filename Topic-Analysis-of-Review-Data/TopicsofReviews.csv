1,"A bank like no other, no bank have such amazing feature to separate your money into different ‚Äúpockets‚Äù to keep track of your goals. Moreover the interest rate they give is the highest for the no effort! Interest are being deposit daily and it‚Äôs amazing to see üíµ coming in to the bank daily! 

The user interfaces is so intuitive that every button can be found with your eyes close, that makes money transfer so much smoother. Also the colours is so slick that I want to turn the app on everyday just to look at it and see the daily interest

2,"Notice that the drop in interest rate of 0.8% in saving accounts. GXS just come out with a reason to say many consumers want a increase in interest rate in main accounts as most of their funds are there to get the 1.2x points for dash and grab spending. Hence they decrease the interest rate to 2.68% in saving account and increase to 2.38% in main account .

The thing is GXS can increase the main account interest and maintain the interest rate in saving account. They will attract more consumer in this case. However, they use this opportunity to decease the interest rate in saving account instead and use the consumer as an excuse for the decrease.

I am very disappointed in GXS and have close my account in GXS. There are other banks offering a higher interest rate such as OCBC and UOB for saving accounts. No point sticking to GXS.","['notice', 'drop', 'interest', 'rate', 'account', 'reason', 'consumer', 'want', 'increase', 'interest', 'rate', 'account', 'fund', 'point', 'dash', 'grab', 'spending', 'hence', 'decrease', 'interest', 'rate', 'account', 'increase', 'account', 'thing', 'increase', 'account', 'interest', 'maintain', 'interest', 'rate', 'account', 'attract', 'consumer', 'case', 'opportunity', 'decease', 'interest', 'rate', 'account', 'consumer', 'excuse', 'decrease', 'account', 'bank', 'offering', 'interest', 'rate', 'ocbc', 'account', 'point']",7,Competition
