Bob Cheung,"Good to see increased competition in the banking space (high interest is good, but inexplicably only given within a saving pocket), but GXS app lacks basic functionality, eg. ability to save payees (at the point of writing this review, these details need to be re-input each time - irritating and error prone). Suggest that rather than working on cool, but otherwise non-essential functions (like saving pockets), the company should focus on the basics first.",3
Nur Atiqah Ismail,"Cannot seem to open the app suddenly. Did not install new apps or change any setting on phone. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling still no avail. Although your CSO has been trying to rectify, it is still unsolvable. Sad, as when it first came out, I was the one of the many who applied in the beginning stage. Your services helped me. But now I have no access to it.",1
Tsayyou Chia,"Terrible experience. Took 4 attempts to finally set up account. Previous 3x received error msg ""couldn't approve your account at this time"". When the account was finally set up a few hours later, the app crashed. Have restarted the phone, uninstalled and reinstalled the app. I'm still stuck at the first page after logging in, which seemed to have a popped up msg/ad but not loading. Then the error msg of ""app is not responding"" appeared and prompted me to close the app.",1

Dylan,"Received email notifying savings account is available to sign up, but when i tried to sign up, i got rejected immediately. No reason was given when rejected, only show faq which does not answer my question. Even after reaching out to the support email, no specific reason was given. I was simply told not eligible. An alternative savings account I suggest would be OCBC 360, which also offer high interest rate with terms and conditions.",1
Benjamin Tan,"Unable to login or use the forgot password function. System only replied with ""something wrong please try again later"" Now I was told I must wait for the next version of app to be rolled out progressively before I can login. Hopefully won't take too long",1
AK Ong,Try logging in after logging out completely. Cannot see Singpass QR at all. How to log in again? Something wrong with new updates?,1
E,"A feature they should implement is to save your recipients which you FAST to, makes it a lot safer as it prevents mistaken sending of funds to unintended recipients after the 1st transfer.",3
Lee Jia Xing,"Gxs is simple and easy to use, with a saving account/pocket that has no TnC. But not being able to add payees for FAST transfer is quite a setback and detrimental considering it as a basic common banking service that most people do. As a digital bank, isn't it pertinent to include basic online banking service like adding of payee?",3
Just Saus,"Seriously makes you wonder how grab and singtel took so long to come up with an app and there is no simple things like adding a payee. The debit card was only recently released when trust came up with a proper product more than a year ago with a proper rewards programme. Just like its owners, GXS is a failure.",1
lim xiangqing,cant logging using finger print . previously still able to use . so pissed off with the update .,1
Jas WJ,"Great app that can park your savings using pockets, but hopefully the interest rate of the savings pockets will increase due to the current economic conditions",4
Vince Chew,Fingerprint login no longer work since 2 months back.. all other bank apps doesn't have such issues.,2
Brendan Chew,Almost perfect; I want to transfer via bank account number but they do no allow me to save the bank details so I'm stuck twitch manually entering the details everytime when I need to do transfer which can be prone to human error.,4
Matt Murati,For 1st time registration signup by singpass and all info's needed but still my application is denied.,1

Peishan Tang,"I not be able to log in GXS bank today after I pay off my 1st outstanding loan. Is there a bug or hack? I hope my $ was offset for the loan. Even even I restart, power on off my phone, after updating the app, I unable to log in. When I log in with fingerprint, keep loading. Pls help.",1
Sky Koh,"Really really damm time wasting, if not ready for sign up don't launch. Close down and don't let people wait for you, uninstalling now. Trust Bank is much better, CRAB!",1
Fuse Akhi,"Reminder, please up to date your app for users to activate Gxs debit physical card. Currently facing a small issue with logging in my GXS app & only through the app. + 5 secret digit number to input. All the best to new peeps have same trouble as me.... Cheers.",4
Zam Bert,Been waiting since july to open an account.. Remembered that i sign up for early access first time round and was told would be informed once new slots are available for sign up.. As weeks goes by i see that other people were invited to open an account but not me.. Now 4 mths later am trying again and signed up again for early access..,1
Nad N,"Been using this bank for a while now and didn't face any major problems. What I enjoyed the most is the saving pockets area where we could create different pockets for each saving we want to do and even add goals into it. The 2.68% per annum is added daily (0.01) as long as you have a minimum of 150 in your savings. If not, you'll have to wait till your it accumulates up to 0.01 to be added. There was also cashback when you make payment using the card which I didn't know till recently.",5
L Sent,I'm stuck on the singpass page without being able to proceed. All is updated to latest ver.,1
Alvin Khah,"Easy to use, clear info and rapid yet secure transactions. Highly recommend.",5
Clement,"Wasn't able to log in since 7 Sept. Called the CSO hotline on 9 Sept and was told to try resending the email OTP. Checked the email junk box and retried multiple times but didn't receive any emails. Was told that they had to check on the back end. When asked when I could receive a response, they mentioned 2 working days?? But this means I wouldn't be able to carry out any transactions for 5 whole days. Imagine if I had a critical transaction to carry out! I would have no access to my funds!!!!",1
Doreen Z,"You are welcome! I had hoped to keep more money long term but after only 1 month with GXS, your interest rate dropped greatly! Please have ""Add Payee"" to reduce errors - no Copy & Paste so we need to memorise long account numbers! Jul2023 Review - Seamless transactions. Great fun bank to bank with. I like the pockets idea where I am able to see where my goals are heading! The interest is the icing on the cake! Great UI and UX! Easiest digital bank to use! Thank you very much, Dev & Team!",4
孔虾粒,"Great interest rates and card spending rebates, and the app is also simple and easy to use.",5
Yw T,I am unable to log in today when i could yesterday. I cant transfer my money out to use. There is no alternative like physical counter or website so my money is stuck when i urgently need my money.,1
Koong Wei Jie,When to sign up for the account in last year august. 5 months has pass still waiting. Please help to solve the issue.,2
Edwin,"Stuck on Oops, something went wrong page when opening the app, while overseas. I can't imagine if I was in a urgent situation and my banking app failed like this. No way to access funds through a browser too means you can't do anything at all other than hope the problem is fixed soon. Put what you can afford to lose.",1
WenWei Shen,"[Update 2023-05-01] issue of display overlay causing screen unresponsiveness has been resolved! [Update 2023-01-25] Thanks to user E L's review, i rem tt my phone has display overlay add-on n this seems to be causing the issue. I tried app on my phone's 2ndary display (dual screen phone) n am able to use app Original review - screen is unresponsive regardless whether launched from GXS app or from Grab app",4
Edmund Siah,"One of the worst app I ever installed. Such a proclaimed digital bank yet can't even get the app to work properly. Since day one till now after sign up, the app never works, keep stating slip-space. If you can't get the app work properly, then don't launch it. How to trust and put our money in such an app if it doesn't even work properly. Trust app is so much better.",1
Kevin Poh,"Looking at past review and after installing the app, I must say the effort to launch progressively paid off instead of rushing into it. Was kind of concern if this is going to take off but I guess the objective is to ensure a safe bankng experience rather than rushing to grab the market. No observable bug and smooth sign in process.",5
Fadli Matswan,"Cannot login all of a sudden. Tried to uninstall and reinstall. Still no changes. What do i do here? I've got a pending repayment due. And if this continues, i will mostly probably be charged the late interest due the the app have login issues.",2
Arathiel,Intuitive and User-Friendly Interface. No doubt there are further improvements to be made. Looking forward to what the digital banking scene has to offer! Suggestion to have an interface/section for users to offer feedback & suggestions for potential pain points/improvements.,5
Renuka Ramalingam,"The app is very user friendly and easy to set up. I personally like the way they take information security seriously by making sure our phone is secure (via pin authentication). With all thats happening around, makes me so much more reassured that they take security seriously!",5
Chloe Lam,"Disappointing app experience, awful faux friendly service. I was invited to join via Grab. After multiple painful attempts to sign up (and v lacklustre UI/UX), I was told that there's been an error, and finally received a vague email stating that I am ineligible, without offering any reason why. After multiple emails, customer service still failed to explain why I am not eligible, while signing off as my 'GXS buddy' everytime. I don't need a buddy from you. I just need you to do your job.",1
Adrian Cheng,"Like this app over Trust and others. Concept similar to Timo bank in VN which I used before when I was living there. 5k account limit is shocking to me since these days where got people only save 5k. Hope for an update on this asap as well as debit card. Otherwise, interface is clean, easy to use, easy to sign up, good interest rate. For now, gxs looks promising to be my permanent savings bank. Others will just serve as my Spent account or salary credit account.",5
Swee Seng,"Your phone cannot be used Lol, which part of my phone have been modified? Nvr root or anything This is something that should not even be released to the public when you can't even get device authentication working UPDATE: So they decided to just close my issue and deemed it as ""resolved"" when it isn't Dont ever use this pos software",1
El Sptr,"1) long waiting list 2) everytime i log into waiting list, it's as if I'm not in the waiting list as they ask me to sign up to be in the waiting list 🙄 alr 4 time alr 3) of course I'm still not in the GXS list Had sent light for the long wait. Meanwhile while it isn't approved I'll delete since I won't be able to use it. 😑 No spaces.",1
Anna Y,"Love the function of having multiple pockets as it helps me to track each target accordingly. Thank you for the genius allocation! Would have given 4.5 if there was, with the 0.5 hoping for unlimited numbers of pockets. :"")",4
Adrian Han,Over lapping wording. Pull down refresh need to tweak more does not feel smooth it all. Opening of account does not work if you are connected to WiFi.,2
khoo ky vinh,Seamless. Got it up and running in less than 5mins! Easy to transfer in and out from other banks. I like the daily interest credit. Helps me set aside money for daily use and motivates me to check how much I'm getting everyday. Dun understand why there are gripes and complaints from other reviewers. This app is fantastic 😍,5
Muhd Rashid,Easy loan and easy payment with no hassle.,5
Andrei Chan,"Download the app, and tried to apply. Got an error message, page cannot download and cannot login at all. Uninstall the app within 5 mins of trying. Don't bother. I got better choices elsewhere.",1
Actavis SG,App is snappy. Interface is simple and straightforward. Most importantly interest is attractive. Keep it up! By the way please add 'Save payee' feature.,5
Goh Hang Boon,"The apps cannot make it. I tried to apply for a loan. After filling up all the forms, unable to proceed after the last question, are you a US citizens. The next button does not pop up be the answer is yes or No.",1
Jason CKM,The links after downloading the app are unclickable to even register. Looks more like a wireframe on a Marvel platform. Lol What a great UX that GXS promises in their marketing but unable to deliver. I wonder what happens if you cannot click in future to transfer your money? I have serious doubts about how legit they are about Fintech with such a haphazard launch.,1
Robbie Foo,Totally absurd and redundant feature that FORCES me to setup a PASSWORD FOR MY PHONE!!! The same kind autocracy and authoritarianism they force down the throat of their delivery riders. I've got at least 3 other banking apps by major banks. NONE.. I repeat .. NONE forces me to modify my phone settings to accommodate them. I'm steering away from this app.,1
Jolie Ang,"Doesn't work on my phone, cannot click and cannot scroll anything. Only works if I open it as a mini pop-up app. Had to create an account via someone else's phone. Please fix!",1
Aliff luffy,Easy to apply good full amount of loan given compare to outside or lending bee ... or they never cut your loan amouny . interest can be save if payment early. multiple loan also can.. only it could be better if can increase loan amount after loan given .. or can be resgistet again once deleted.,5
k.naresh kumar,"Fast and easier way to get the loan amount, as a foreigner i cant make but my friend helped me, it will be useful if foreigner also can borrow.. This is a suggestion.. Thanks",5
Randy Sugianto 「Yuku」,"Why do the app ask me to rate on Play Store if my rating on the app is 5, but there was no such questions when I put a 1 rating on the app? It encourages unfair ratings on the Play Store.",1
TAN CH,"The app works great, simple yet effective enough to encourage savings via ""pockets"" so that users do not unknowingly overspent using the main account and that explain the lower interest as compared to funds kept inside the ""pockets"". Although its good to start small, i do hope the bank can increase the saving caps to encourage even more savings.Security wise while i think is on par with industry standard but there are still room to enhance it further as scammers are getting smarter everyday.",5
Tony Low,I don't set. A password in my phone n not allow me to down load this apps,5
Nurhartini Nurhartini,They unable to process my application. 4x attempt,1

Kam Weng Goh,"I installed the app and got to the first screen. When I tried to proceed, it popped up a message saying and there is an overlap app that is NOT SECURED. It then asked if I want to proceed. What is this about?",1
N O,"Misleading advertisement for flexiloan promotion for July 2023, stated rate as low as 2.99% p.a. Issued a rate that was extraordinary and way beyond all major banks that would offered even at their highest peak rate. A real shock of disbelief, thinking was a sign-up bug but it ended to be their best rate offered. Would be really cautious on signing up any offers from GXS even though their app user interface, interaction, and wording do project confidence in honoring their offer.",1
sherrick Khoo,"Sign up failed without given a reason. Ask to see FAQ but click it doesn't link to it. Hello! I don't know where you guys are heading. If you don't want people to sign up, just cross out at the beginning, are you trying to gather personal data???!!!!!",1
Ben Ding,App auto exit after I clicked pocket account icon to see the details of each pocket account. Happened on from yesterday. Issue resolved after app update on 8 Feb. Thank you for the swift response.,5
jeffrey ooi,I have merely tried to apply for your flexi loan on this app. But when i tried to applied like 9 times straight i have been instantly being asked to reapply over and over again. Very bad for user experience and does not live up to expectations till today,2
Literally Anything Poh,"forces you to use singpass to register, is slow when browsing the FAQs, and the login doesn't allow singpass-based password login, when the registration does??? maximum frustration",1
Gary Goh,"The screen cannot respond entirely.. After going through the screen login, the app completely doesn't respond touch. Very buggy.",2
Hiok,"Easy to set up and smooth sign in + attractive interest rate, it would be great if the saving caps could be higher than $5000 :)",5
Wee Kek Tan,Kudos to GXS for responding promptly to the error that I experienced accessing the pockets. The latest update resolved the problem. Thank you!,5
Nor Eliya Khan Ali,First time checking out on dis and didnt know grab came with this and enhanced features was super accessible indeed within mins i was able.to withdraw e.loan even though e security was quite super securable which i liked.thank u for making things affordable and reachable for difficult times for mummies👌🙏🥰🌹,5
ASL 97,"Update 2023/07/20: saw the news about more slot being open but it still gives the same ""library tampering"" warning and force closed, no idea why, maybe it's because of developer mode is enable or whatever, but I am an app developer and no other bank apps complain about anything.",1
MaP Undey,"Just found out that they are reducing their interest rate to a pathetic 2.68%. don't like this bait and switch marketing strategy, lure us with high interest rate then suddenly drop the interest rates once they get enough sign ups. [Update] Whats the point of increasing the main wallet interest when no one puts money there? Its not like you're increasing it back to 3.48% right? The pt is the big reduction of the Pockets interest rates which is the key thing that people arent happy about.",1
Aaron Koo,Seamless registration. All done in less than 15 mins. Signed up and funds loaded. I guess they improved the app compared to the issues faced by other users earlier on.,5

Chiam Mack,Simple to use. Took a short while to know how to process. Hope that they can maintain the great interest. Good job GXS.,5
Alifuddin Salleh,Its a simple bank app to help you save and transfer your daily needs. Just dont split screen or use another app when using it.,5
Felicia Lim,"Hi, is something wrong with the app? Am error message says ""Something went wrong"" when I tried to log in with the Passcode I set yesterday.",2
Wei Ping Yuen,Scan QR feature failed big time! Parsed 16.2 as 16.02! Amatuer mistake. Did the developer of this feature attend more than a day of class in CS?!,1
Sanjay Sachdev,Hi please take note your app shouldn't be detecting whether if my phone has a pin number or not. This is a red flag on your digital banking system. No other bank is doing this including Trust Bank who is your competitor and they are doing better than you. Btw do not insult Singtel share holders like me.,1
Baggio Pan,Ok Good system.,5

Emirul Izma Abdul,Easy and fast app,5
