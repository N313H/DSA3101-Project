      "Like this app over Trust and others. Concept similar to Timo bank in VN which I used before when I was living there. 5k account limit is shocking to me since these days where got people only save 5k. Hope for an update on this asap as well as debit card. Otherwise, interface is clean, easy to use, easy to sign up, good interest rate. For now, gxs looks promising to be my permanent savings bank. Others will just serve as my Spent account or salary credit account.\n",

      "The app works great, simple yet effective enough to encourage savings via \"pockets\" so that users do not unknowingly overspent using the main account and that explain the lower interest as compared to funds kept inside the \"pockets\". Although its good to start small, i do hope the bank can increase the saving caps to encourage even more savings.Security wise while i think is on par with industry standard but there are still room to enhance it further as scammers are getting smarter everyday.\n",

      "Looking at past review and after installing the app, I must say the effort to launch progressively paid off instead of rushing into it. Was kind of concern if this is going to take off but I guess the objective is to ensure a safe bankng experience rather than rushing to grab the market. No observable bug and smooth sign in process.\n",
