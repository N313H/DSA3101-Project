Mostly bad reviews and issues. I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t need developer reply to my review here as I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m absolutely not going to touch this bank anymore. And biggest joke of all, you don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t even have the most basic banking feature to save payee details. What kind of app development staff and quality is that???.\",\n",
